# Agent Notes for Rodeo

- CSS utilities are centralized under `src/renderer/src/assets/styles/`. Reuse the `ro-` utility classes (border, background, text) instead of hardcoding `var(--ro-*)` values inline.
- Prefer shared UI primitives (Button, Input, DateInput, Card, Field, Label, etc.) before rolling custom elements. If a variant is missing, extend the component rather than hand-styling.
- Modal interactions should use `Modal` component; avoid ad-hoc absolute overlays.
- Toasts: use Sonner (`toast.*`) sparingly but consistently for success/error feedback.
- Avoid inline anonymous handlers for complex actions; extract helper functions to keep JSX tidy.
- Persistent data: use the preferences provider for theme/recents and IPC via preload for tournament operations.
- When adding schema changes, remember to run `npm run db:gen` to update Drizzle migrations.
- Runtime: Electron (Chromium); assume Electron APIs (e.g. showPicker) are available.
- Default mindset: propose the cleanest long-term approach; refactors are welcome when they improve the foundation. 
- Do no mess with files in src/core/db/migrations. You can read them, but they are auto generated by drizzy and should not be manually edited or created.
- We have react-icons, feel free to use it.
- Always run typecheck, lint and test to make sure you didn't break shit.
- Always prefer to use the "@" reference over relative paths when importing. ex. @renderer/...
- Never just jump into coding when I ask a question. Always address the question first so that we are sure we are moving on a mutually agreeable path.
- Avoid aliasing existing type names; use the canonical type directly instead of re-exporting under a new name.
